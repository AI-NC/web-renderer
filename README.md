# AI-NC Web Renderer

This package contains AI-NC's online model viewer, written in Rust and compiled into Web Assembly (WASM) using Web Pack.

The renderer is designed to be embedded in a JavaScrypt or TypeScrypt web page, and is provided as a raw WASM package, a prebuilt Vue Component, and a prebuilt React component.

# Access to packages and examples

All three packages are provided using a private NPM registry where the current and previous versions can be downloaded. New updates will be pushed to this registry along with patch notes and feature additions.

Please contact george@ai-nc.com for access to the full AI-NC SDK repository with examples and additional documentation.

In order to download packages from the registry you will need an authorization token, you should have been provided with one, but i am *fairly sure* you can generate one with the github account that was given access to the SDK repository.

## Local development

For local development add a `.npmrc` file at the root level of your project *(same level as the package.json)*, Make sure this file is added to your `.gitignore`

In that file add:
```
@ai-nc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc
//npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc:_authToken=[YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN]
```

Then packages can be added to you `package.json` as a dependency: 

```
"dependencies": {
    "@ai-nc/renderer-core": "^0.1.0",
    "@ai-nc/react-renderer": "^0.1.0",
    ...
},
```

or installed normally:

```
npm install @ai-nc/react-renderer
```

**Ensure your no file containing your authorization token is committed to git**

## Deployment

To allow the use of these packages in a build environment add the following commands to your preBuild phase (these must be executed before `npm install`).

```
npm config set @ai-nc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc:_authToken=[YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN]
```

For example the `amplify.yml` for deployment on AWS Amplify could be:

```
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm config set @ai-nc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc
        - npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/ai-nc:_authToken=[YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN]
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

# Access to the AI-NC API

In order to get `.golf` files, `.step` files must be sent to the AI-NC API. This API is currently being served as a beta at the url:

```
https://masher-zkwr5vkj.fermyon.app
```

To convert a step file must be sent to this address as a POST request. A header must be added to this request to authorize the use of the endpoint.

```
{ Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY }
```

Finally the response must be received as bytes, or a `Uint8Array` in JS/TS. Javascript has a tendency to turn things into strings, so make sure your request is set upr properly if you are having trouble loading the resulting file into the renderer.

## Known Limitations

Currently the API is in beta. This means all .golf files should be treated as deprecated as they **will not work** with the full version of the renderer.

In addition during beta the endpoint is hosted on a very light server, and large step files may not load before the response times out.
