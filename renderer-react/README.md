# AI-NC React Web Renderer

This NPM package contains a prebuilt react component that contains AI-NC's Web Assembly .golf renderer.

**For information on how to access and deploy the renderer see the repository level readme, It is also recommended you look over the README for @ai-nc/renderer-core**

There are 2 options for running this project.

Using `npm start` will launch a demo application that allows a local step file to be rendered in the browser.

Using `npm build` will compile the renderer component into a separate types and javascript file that are then used to create the `@ai-nc/renderer-react` package for embedding into other web pages.

## Importing the renderer

The renderer is imported from the `renderer-react` package:

```typescript
import { AINCRenderer } from "@ai-nc/renderer-react";
```

It can then be imbedded in HTML just like any other react component

```html
return (
  <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}>
    <AINCRenderer buffer={golf_file_as_bytes}></AINCRenderer>
  </div>
);
```

## Renderer Props

Currently the renderer has one prop buffer. This must be a .golf file as a Uint8Array when the renderer is loaded into the DOM tree. For details on the .golf file see the readme in `renderer-core`.

**`More config and functionality is being added the props`**
